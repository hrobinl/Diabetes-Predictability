# Diabetes-Predictability

***Overview**

In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on features such as Pregancies, Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. 


The data set used in this project was taken from Kaggle and included 768 examples. "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage."
